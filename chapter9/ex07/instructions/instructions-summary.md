## Instructions
Write a program that declares a `struct` to store the data of a football player (player’s name, player’s position, number of touchdowns, number of catches, number of passing yards, number of receiving yards, and the number of rushing yards).

Declare an array of 10 components to store the data of 10 football players. 

Your program must contain a function to input data and a function to output data. Add functions to search the array to find the index of a specific player, and up-date the data of a player. (You may assume that the input data is stored in a file.) Before the program terminates, give the user the option to save data in a file. Your program should be menu driven, giving the user various choices. 

An example of the program is shown below:
