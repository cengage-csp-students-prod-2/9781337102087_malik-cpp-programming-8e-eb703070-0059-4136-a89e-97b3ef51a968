## Instructions
Assume the definition of _Exercise 2_, which defines the `struct computerType`. Write a program that declares a variable of type `computerType`, prompts the user to input data about a computer, and outputs the computerâ€™s data. 

Example input and output is shown below:
```
Enter the name of the manufacturer: McPC

Processor: Intel GFX                                                 
Ram: 8                                                               
Hard Drive Size: 1000                                                
Year Built: 2016                                                     
Price: $1200.00 
```

Instructions from *Exercise 2* have been posted below for your convenience. 

### Exercise 2 ###
Define a `struct` `computerType` to store the following data about a computer: Manufacturer (`string`), model type (`string`), processor type (`string`), ram (`int`) in GB, hard drive size (`int`) in GB, year when the computer was built (`int`), and the price (`double`).
