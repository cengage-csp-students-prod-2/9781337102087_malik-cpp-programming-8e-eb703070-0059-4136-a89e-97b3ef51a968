## Instructions
*Example 6-16* shows how to write a program to factor a polynomial of the form _x² + bx + c_, where *b* and *c* are integers. Modify the program so that it can also factor polynomials of the form *ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c* , where *a*, *b*, and *c* are integers. Note that the polynomial _ - 2x² - 3x + 2_  can be factored as: _ - 2x² - 3x + 2 = (-2x + 1)(x + 2) = - (2x - 1)(x + 2)_.
