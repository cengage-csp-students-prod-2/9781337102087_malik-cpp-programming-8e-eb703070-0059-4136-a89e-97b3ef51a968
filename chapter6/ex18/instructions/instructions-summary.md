## Instructions
The statements in the provided program found in *main.cpp* are not in the correct order. Rearrange the statements so that the program outputs the total time an employee spent on the job each day. 
The program asks the user to:
* enter the employeeâ€™s name,

* departure time (departure hour, departure minute, AM or PM).

The program also allows the user to run the program as long as the user wishes. After rearranging the statements, your program must be properly indented.
