## Instructions
Write a program to test the functions described in *Exercises 23* and *26* of this chapter.

Instructions for *Exercise 23* and *Exercise 26* have been posted below for your convenience. 

### Exercise 23
Write the definition of a `void` function that takes as input an integer and outputs two times the number if it is even; otherwise it outputs fiveÂ times the number.

### Exercise 26
Write the definition of a `void` function that takes as input two integer values, say `n` and `m`. The function returns the sum and average of all the numbers between `n` and `m` (inclusive). 

*Be sure to place a space between the two numbers during the input of the integers.*
