## Instructions
Let *a* and *b* be integers such that either *a* or *b* is nonzero. The greatest common divisor, written *gcd(a, b)*, of *a* and *b* is the largest positive integer that divides both *a* and *b*. Your program must contain a function that takes as input two integers and returns the *gcd* of the integers.
