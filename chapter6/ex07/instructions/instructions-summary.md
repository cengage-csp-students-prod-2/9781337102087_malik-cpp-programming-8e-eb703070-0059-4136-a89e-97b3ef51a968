## Instructions
Write a program that prompts the user to enter two positive integers less than 1,000,000,000 and the program outputs the sum of all the prime numbers between the two integers. 

Two prime numbers are called twin primes, if the difference between the two primes is 2 or -2. 

Have the program output all the twin primes and the number of twin primes between the two integers.
