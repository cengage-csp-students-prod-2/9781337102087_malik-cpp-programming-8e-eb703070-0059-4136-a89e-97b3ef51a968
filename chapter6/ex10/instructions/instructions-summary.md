## Instructions
Modify the roll dice program, *Example 6-4*, so that it allows the user to enter the desired sum of the numbers to be rolled. Also, allow the user to call the `rollDice` function as many times as the user desires.

The code provided in *Example 6-4* has been provided for you in the editor. A synopsis of the instructions for *Example 6-4* are posted below for your convenience. 

### Example 6-4 ###
In this example, we write a function that rolls a pair of dice until the sum of the numbers rolled is a specific number. We also want to know the number of times the dice are rolled to get the desired sum.

The smallest number on each die is 1, and the largest number is 6. So the smallest sum of the numbers rolled is 2, and the largest sum of the numbers rolled is 12.
