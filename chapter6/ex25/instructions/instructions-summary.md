## Instructions
The cost to become a member of a fitness center is as follows: 
* the senior citizens discount is 30%; 
* if the membership is bought and paid for 12 or more months, the discount is 15%; 
* if more than five personal training sessions are bought and paid for, the discount on each session is 20%. 


Write a menu-driven program that determines the cost of a new membership. Your program must contain a function that displays the general information about the fitness center and its charges, a function to get all the necessary information to determine the membership cost, and a function to determine the membership cost. Use appropriate parameters to pass information in and out of a function. (Do not use any global variables.)

An example of the program is shown below: 

```text
Welcome to Stay Healthy and Fit center.
This program determines the cost of a new membership.
If you are a senior citizen, then the discount is 30% of the regular membership price.
If you buy membership for twelve months and pay today, the discount is 15%.
If you buy and pay for 6 or more personal training session today, the discount on each session is 20%.
Enter the cost of a regular membership per month: 50

Enter the cost of one personal training session: 10

Are you a senior citizen (Y,y/N,n): n

Enter the number of personal training sessions bought: 3

Enter the number of month you are paying for: 1

The membership cost = $80.00
```

> Since your program handles currency, make sure to use a data type that can store decimals with a decimal precision of 2.
