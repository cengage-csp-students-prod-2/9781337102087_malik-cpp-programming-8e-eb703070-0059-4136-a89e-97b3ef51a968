## Instructions
Write a value-returning function, `isVowel`, that returns the value **true** if a given character is a vowel and otherwise returns **false**.

For the input **E**, your output should look like the following: 
```
E is a vowel: 1
```

> When printing the value of a bool,  `true` will be displayed as **1** and `false` will be displayed as **0**.
