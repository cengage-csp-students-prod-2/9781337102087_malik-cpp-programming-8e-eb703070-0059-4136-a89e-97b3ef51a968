## Instructions

The included program found in *main.cpp* is designed to find the area of a rectangle, the area of a circle, or the volume of a cylinder. 

However:
* the statements are in the incorrect order; 
* the function calls are incorrect; 
* the logical expression in the while loop is incorrect; 
* the function definitions are incorrect; 
* You may assume that the value of Ï€ = **3.14159**.

Rewrite the program so that it works correctly. Your program must be properly indented. (Note that the program is menu driven and allows the user to run the program as long as the user wishes.)

> Format your output with `setprecision(2)` to ensure the proper number of decimals for testing!
