## Instructions
Write a program that reads a string and outputs the number of times each lowercase vowel appears in it. Your program must contain a function called `countVowels` with one of its parameters as a `string` variable and return the number of times each lowercase vowel appears in it. Also, write a program to test your function.  

An example of the program is shown below: 
```text
Enter a string: 
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
The number of a's: 1
The number of e's: 2
The number of i's: 2
The number of o's: 3
The number of u's: 1
```

> If `str` is a variable of type `string`, then `str.at(i)` returns the character at the **ith** position. The position of the first character is **0.** Also, `str.length()` returns the length of the `str`, that is, the number of characters in `str`.
