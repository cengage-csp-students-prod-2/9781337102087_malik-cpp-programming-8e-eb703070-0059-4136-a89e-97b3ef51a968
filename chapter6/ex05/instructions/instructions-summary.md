## Instructions
Write a program to test the functions described in _Exercises 11_ and _14_ of this chapter.

Instructions for *Exercise 11* and *Exercise 14* have been posted below for your convenience. 

### Exercise 11 ###
Write the definition of a function that takes as input a `char` value, and returns `true` if the character is a whitespace character; otherwise it returns `false`. 

If the character is a whitespace character, output the following message:
`The character you entered is a whitespace character`, otherwise output: `The character you entered is not a whitespace character`. 

### Exercise 14 ###
Write the definition of a function that takes as input three numbers. The function returns `true` if the floor of the product of the first two numbers equals the floor of the third number; otherwise it returns `false`. (Assume that the three numbers are of type `double`.)  Output the appropriate message: 
`The product of the first two numbers is not equal to the floor of the third number`

or 

`The product of the first two numbers is equal to the floor of the third number`
