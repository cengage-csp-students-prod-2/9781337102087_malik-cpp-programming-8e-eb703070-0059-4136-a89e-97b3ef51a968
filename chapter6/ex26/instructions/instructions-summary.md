## Instructions
Write a program that outputs inflation rates for two successive years and whether the inflation is increasing or decreasing. Ask the user to input the current price of an item and its price one year and two years ago. 

To calculate the inflation rate for a year, subtract the price of the item for that year from the price of the item one year ago and then divide the result by the price a year ago. 

Your program must contain at least the following functions: 
* a function to get the input;
* a function to calculate the results; 
* a function to output the results. 

Use appropriate parameters to pass the information in and out of the function. 

An example of the program output and input is shown below: 
```text
Enter the current price of the item: 10

Enter the price of the item one year ago: 8

Enter the price of the item two years ago: 4

Current year inflation: 0.25
Inflation one year ago: 1.00
Inflation is not increasing.
```
> The last three lines above should be the exact wording of your output!

> Since your program handles currency, make sure to use a data type that can store decimals with a decimal precision of 2.
