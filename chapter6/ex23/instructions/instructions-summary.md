## Instructions
Redo *Programming Exercise 22* as follows. 
Write a program that reads a string and outputs the number of times each lowercase vowel appears in it. Your program must contain a function with one of its parameters as a `char` variable, and if the character is a vowel, it increments that vowel's count.

Instructions for *Programming Exercise 22* are posted below for your convenience. 

### Programming Exercise 22 ###
Write a program that reads a string and outputs the number of times each lowercase vowel appears in it. Your program must contain a function with one of its parameters as a `string` variable and return the number of times each lowercase vowel appears in it. Also write a program to test your function. (Note that if `str` is a variable of type `string`, then `str.at(i)` returns the character at the *i* th position. The position of the first character is 0. Also, `str.length()` returns the length of the `str`, that is, the number of characters in `str`.)


An example of the program is shown below: 

```
Enter a string:
Hello
The number of a's: 0
The number of e's: 1
The number of i's: 0
The number of o's: 1
The number of u's: 0
```
