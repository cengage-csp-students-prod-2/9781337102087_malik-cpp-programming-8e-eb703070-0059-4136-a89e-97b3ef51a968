## Instructions
(Pipe problem - requires trigonometry) A pipe is to be carried around the right-angled corner of two intersecting corridors. Suppose that the widths of the two intersecting corridors are 5 feet and 8 feet (see *Figure 6-19* below). 

Your objective is to find the length of the longest pipe, rounded to the nearest foot, that can be carried level around the right-angled corner.

Write a program that prompts the user to input the widths of both hallways. The program then outputs the value of theta (`$\theta$`) and the length of the longest pipe, rounded to the nearest foot, that can be carried level around the right-angled corner. 

(Note that the length of the pipe is given by l = AB + BC = 8/sin( θ) + 5/cos( θ), where 0 <  θ< &#x3C0;/2.)

> Format your output with `setprecision(6)` to ensure the proper number of decimals for testing!
