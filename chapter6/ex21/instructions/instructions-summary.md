## Instructions
Write a program that prints the day number of the year, given the date in the form month-day-year. 

For example, if the input is **1-1-2006**, the day number is **1**; if the input is **12-25-2006**, the day number is **359**. 

The program should check for a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100. For example, 1992 and 2008 are divisible by 4, but not by 100. 

A year that is divisible by 100 is a leap year if it is also divisible by 400. For example, 1600 and 2000 are divisible by 400. However, 1800 is not a leap year because 1800 is not divisible by 400.
