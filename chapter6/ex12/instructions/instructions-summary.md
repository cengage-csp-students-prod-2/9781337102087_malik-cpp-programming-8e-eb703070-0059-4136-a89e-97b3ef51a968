## Instructions
Write a program that takes, as input, five numbers and outputs the mean (average) and standard deviation of the numbers. If the numbers are _x&#8321;, x&#8322;, x&#8323;, x&#8324;, and x&#8325;_, then the mean is:  

_x = (x&#8321;+ x&#8322;+ x&#8323;+ x&#8324;+x&#8325;)/5_   

and the standard deviation is:  

_s = √(((x&#8321;-x)²+(x&#8322;-x)²+(x&#8323;-x)²+(x&#8324;-x)²+(x&#8325;-x)²)/5)_
 
Your program must contain at least the following functions: a function that calculates and returns the mean and a function that calculates the standard deviation.

> Format your output with `setprecision(2)` to ensure the proper number of decimals for testing!
