## Instructions ##
Consider the `class` `dateType` given in *Chapter 11*. In this class, add the functions to overload the increment and decrement operators to increase the date by a day and decrease the date by a day, respectively; relational operators to compare two dates; and stream operators for easy input and output. 

>Assume that the date is input and output in the form **MM-DD- YYYY**.

Also write a program to test your class.
