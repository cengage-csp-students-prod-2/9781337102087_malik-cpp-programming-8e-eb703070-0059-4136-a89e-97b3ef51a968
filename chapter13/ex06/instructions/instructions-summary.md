## Instructions

The increment and relational operators in the `class` `clockType` are overloaded as member functions. Rewrite the definition of the `class` `clockType` so that these operators are overloaded as nonmember functions. Also, overload the post-increment operator for the `class` `clockType` as a nonmember.

Write the definitions of the member functions of the `class` `clockType` as designed in the step above.

Write a test program that tests various operations on the class as designed in the steps above.
