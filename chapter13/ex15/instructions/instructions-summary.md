## Instructions

In _Example 13-10_, the `class` template `arrayListType` is designed to implement a list in a program. For illustration purposes, that example included only the sorting operation. 

Extend the definition of the class template to include the remove and search operations. Write the definitions of the member functions to implement the `class` template `arrayListType`. 

Also, write a test program to test various operations on a list.
