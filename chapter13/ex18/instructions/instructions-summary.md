Programming *Exercise 15, Chapter 11*, describes how to design the `class` `pointType` to implement a point. Redo this programming exercise so that the `class` `pointType`:

1. Overloads the stream insertion operator, `<<`, for easy output.
2. Overloads the stream extraction operator, `>>`, for easy input. (A point is input as *(a, b)*.)
3. Overloads the assignment operator to copy a point into another point.
4. Overloads the binary operator `+`, as a member function, so that it returns the distance between two points.
5. Overloads the operator `==`, as a member function, so that it returns **true** if two points are the same; **false** otherwise.
6. Overloads the operator !=, as a member function, so that it returns **true** if two points are not the same; **false** otherwise.

Write a program to test your class.
