*Chapter 11* defined the `class` `boxType` by extending the definition of the `class` `rectangleType`. In this exercise, derive the `class` `boxType` from the `class` `rectangleType`, defined in *Exercise 1*, add the functions to overload the operators `+`,` â€“`, `*`, `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `<`, `>=`, `>`, and pre- and post-increment and decrement operators as members of the `class` `boxType`. Also overload the operators `<<` and `>>`. Overload the relational operators by considering the volume of the boxes. For example, two boxes are the same if they have the same volume.

Write the definitions of the functions of the `class` `boxType` as defined above and then write a test program that tests various operations on the `class`.
