## Instructions ##
Consider the classes `class` `cashRegister` and `dispenserType` given in the Programming Example “Juice Machine” in *Chapter 10*.

1. In the `class` `cashRegister`, add the functions to overload the binary operators `+` and `– `to add and subtract an amount in a cash register; the relational operators to compare the amount in two cash registers; and the stream insertion operator for easy output.

2. The `class` `dispenserType`, in the Programming Example “Juice Machine” in *Chapter 10*, is designed to implement a dispenser to hold and release products. In this class, add the functions to overload the increment and decrement operators to increment and decrement the number of items by one, respectively, and the stream insertion operator for easy output.

Write a program to test the classes designed in steps 1 and 2.
