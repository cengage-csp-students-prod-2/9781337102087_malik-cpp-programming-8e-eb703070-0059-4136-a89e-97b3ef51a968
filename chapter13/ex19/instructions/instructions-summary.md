Programming *Exercise 18, Chapter 10*, describes how to design the `class` `lineType` to implement a line. Redo this programming exercise so that the `class` `lineType`:

1. Overloads the stream insertion operator, `<<`,  for easy output.
2. Overloads the stream extraction operator, `>>`, for easy input. (The line *ax + by = c* is input as *(a, b, c)*.)
3. Overloads the assignment operator to copy a line into another line.
4. Overloads the unary operator `+`, as a member function, so that it returns **true** if a line is vertical; **false** otherwise.
5. Overloads the unary operator `â€“`, as a member function, so that it returns **true** if a line is horizontal; **false** otherwise.
6. Overloads the operator `==`, as a member function, so that it returns **true** if two lines are equal; **false** otherwise.
7. Overloads the operator `||`, as a member function, so that it returns **true** if two lines are parallel; **false** otherwise.
8. Overloads the operator `&&`, as a member function, so that it returns **true** if two lines are perpendicular; **false** otherwise.

Write a program to test your class.
