## Instructions

Extend the definition of the `class` `newString` as follows:

1. Overload the operators `+` and `+=` to perform the string concatenation operations. _(Note: ensure that your overloaded operators can perform concatenation with both `string` and `char` data types as parameters.)_
2. Add the function `length()` to return the length of the string.

Write a test program to test various operations on the `newString` objects.
