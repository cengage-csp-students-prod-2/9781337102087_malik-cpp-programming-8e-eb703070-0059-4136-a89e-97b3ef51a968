## Instructions
The program in *Example 5-4* uses a sentinel control loop to process cookies sales data. 

Assume that the data is provided in a file called *Ch5_Ex18Data.txt* and the first line in the file specifies the cost of one box.

Modify the program (in *main.cpp*) so that it uses an EOF-controlled loop to process the data from the text file.
