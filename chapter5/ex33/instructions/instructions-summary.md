## Instructions
Bianca is preparing special dishes for her daughterâ€™s birthday. 

It takes her *a* minutes to prepare the first dish, and each following dish takes *b* minutes longer than the previous dish. She has *t* minutes to prepare the dishes. 

For example, if the first dish takes *a* = **10** minutes and *b* = **5**, then the second dish will take **15** minutes, the third dish will take **20** minutes, and so on. 

If she has **80** minutes to prepare the dishes, then she can prepare four dishes because **10** + **15** + **20** + **25** = **70**.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the values of *a*, *b*, and *t*, and outputs the number of dishes Bianca can prepare.
