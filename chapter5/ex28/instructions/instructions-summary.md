## Summary
(**Apartment problem**) A real estate office handles, say, 50 apartment units. When the rent is, say, $600 per month, all the units are occupied.

However, for each, say, $40 increase in rent, one unit becomes vacant.  Moreover, each occupied unit requires an average of $27 per month for  maintenance. 

How many units should be rented to maximize the profit?

## Instructions
Write a program that prompts the user to enter:
1. The total number of units.
2. The rent to occupy all the units.
3. Amount to maintain a rented unit.
4. The increase in rent that results in a vacant unit.

The program then outputs:
1. The number of units to be rented to maximize the profit
2. The maximum profit

> Since your program handles currency, make sure to use a data type that can store decimals with a decimal precision of 2.
