##Instructions

Write a program that uses `do`...`while` loops to perform the following steps:
1. Prompt the user to input two integers: `firstNum` and `secondNum`
 * (`firstNum` must be less than `secondNum`).
2. Output all odd numbers between `firstNum` and `secondNum`.
3. Output the sum of all even numbers between `firstNum` and `secondNum`.
4. Output the numbers and their squares between **1** and **10**.
 * Separate the numbers by any amount of spaces.
5. Output the sum of the square of the odd numbers between `firstNum` and `secondNum`.
6. Output all uppercase letters from A-Z.
