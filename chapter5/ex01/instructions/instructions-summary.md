num to hold the user input integer.
digit to hold each respective digit of the integer.
sum to hold the sum of the digits in the integer; Initialized to zero.
pwr to hold the power of a digit; Initialized to zero.

* **3456** as **3 4 5 6**
* **8030** as **8 0 3 0**
* **2345526** as **2 3 4 5 5 2 6**
* **4000** as **4 0 0 0**
* **-2345** as **2 3 4 5**
