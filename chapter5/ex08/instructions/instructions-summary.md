## Instructions

Write a program that uses `while` loops to perform the following steps:
1. Prompt the user to input two integers: `firstNum` and `secondNum`
 * (`firstNum` must be less than `secondNum` and there should be a space between the two numbers entered.).
2. Output all odd numbers between `firstNum` and `secondNum`.
 * Separate each number with a space
3. Output the sum of all even numbers between `firstNum` and `secondNum`.
4. Output the numbers and their squares between **1** and **10**.
5. Output the sum of the square of the odd numbers between `firstNum` and `secondNum`.
6. Output all uppercase letters.
 * Separate each letter with a space
