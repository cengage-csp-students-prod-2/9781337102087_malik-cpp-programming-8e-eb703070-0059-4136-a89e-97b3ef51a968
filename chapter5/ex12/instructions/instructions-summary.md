## Instructions
The population of town *A* is less than the population of town *B*. However, the population of town *A* is growing faster than the population of town *B*. 

Write a program that prompts the user to enter:
1. The population of town *A* 
2. The population of town *B* 
3. The growth rate of town *A*
4. The growth rate of town *B*

The program outputs:
1. After how many years will the population of town *A* be greater than or equal to the population of town *B*.
2. The populations of both of the towns at that time. 

(A sample input is: 
Population of town *A* = **5,000**
Growth rate of town *A* = **4%**
Population of town *B* = **8,000**
Growth rate of town *B* = **2%**)
