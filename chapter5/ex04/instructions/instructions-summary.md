## Summary
To make telephone numbers easier to remember, some companies use letters to show their telephone number. For example, using letters, the telephone number **438-5626** can be shown as **GET LOAN**. 

In some cases, to make a telephone number meaningful, companies might use more than seven letters. For example, **225-5466** can be displayed as **CALL HOME**, which uses eight letters. 

## Instructions
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a telephone number expressed in letters and outputs the corresponding telephone number in digits. 

If the user enters more than seven letters, then process only the first seven letters. 

Also output the - (hyphen) after the third digit. 

Allow the user to use both uppercase and lowercase letters as well as spaces between words. 

Moreover, your program should process as many telephone numbers as the user wants.

Use the dialpad below for reference:

The program should accept input and produce output similar to the example program execution below.

The corresponding telephone number is:
