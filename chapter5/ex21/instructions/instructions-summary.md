## Instructions
Enhance your program from *Exercise 20* by first telling the user the minimum monthly payment and then prompting the user to enter the monthly payment. 

Your last payment might be more than the remaining loan amount and interest on it. In this case, output the actual amount of the last payment. Also, output the total interest paid.
