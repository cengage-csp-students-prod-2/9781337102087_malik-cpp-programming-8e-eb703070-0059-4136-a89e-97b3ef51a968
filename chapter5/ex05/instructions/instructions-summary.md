## Instructions
Write a program that prompts the user to enter two integers with a space between the two integers. For example: integers 12 and 30 would be as follows: 12 30

The program then outputs how many numbers are multiples of 3 and how many numbers are multiples of 5 between the two integers (inclusive). 

Be sure to account for when the numbers are entered in ascending or descending order.
