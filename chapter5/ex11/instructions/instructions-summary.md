## Instructions
The program in the *Programming Example: Fibonacci Number* does not check:
1. Whether the first number entered by the user is less than or equal to the second number and whether both the numbers are non-negative. 

2. Whether the user entered a valid value for the position of the desired number in the Fibonacci sequence. 

Rewrite that program so that it checks for these things.

NOTES:
* If an invalid number is entered for case 1 above, prompt the user to enter both numbers again.

* If an invalid number is entered for case 2, prompt the user to enter a value until a valid value is entered.
