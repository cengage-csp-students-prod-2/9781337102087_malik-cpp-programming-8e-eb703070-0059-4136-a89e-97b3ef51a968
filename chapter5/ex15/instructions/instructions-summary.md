## Instructions
The program in *Example 5-6* implements the *Number Guessing Game*. However, in that program, the user is given as many tries as needed to guess the correct number. 

Rewrite the program so that the user has no more than five tries to guess the correct number. 

Your program should print an appropriate message, such as **“You win!”** or **“You lose!”**.
