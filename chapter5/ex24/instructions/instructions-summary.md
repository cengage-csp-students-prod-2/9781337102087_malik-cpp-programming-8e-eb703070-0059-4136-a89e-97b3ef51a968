## Instructions
Write a program to test the code in *Example 5-23* (provided here in the *main.cpp* file). The program should read in the each line of *Exp_5_23.txt* file and calculate the total value for each line. 

In order to complete the program, you will need to declare the following variables: 
1. `counter`
2. `sum`
3. `num`
4. `infile`

An example of the program output is shown below:
```c++
Line 1: Sum = 420
Line 2: Sum = 511
Line 3: Sum = 0
Line 4: Sum = 694
Line 5: Sum = 398
```
