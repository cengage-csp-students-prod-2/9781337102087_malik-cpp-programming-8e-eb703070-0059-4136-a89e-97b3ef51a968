## Summary ##
Certificate of deposit (CD): In an account of this type, money is left for some time, and these accounts draw higher interest rates than savings or checking accounts. Suppose that you purchase a CD for six months. Then we say that the CD will mature in six months. The penalty for early withdrawal is stiff. Figure 12-22 in the textbook shows the inheritance hierarchy of these bank accounts.
