## Summary ##
**Savings accounts**: Suppose that the bank offers two types of savings accounts: one that has no
minimum balance and a lower interest rate and another that requires a minimum balance and has
a higher interest rate.

## Instructions ##
Write the definitions of the classes described in this step. 
1.  **savingsAccount**: A savings account is a bank account. Therefore, it inherits all the properties of
a bank account. Furthermore, a savings account also pays interest.
2. **highInterestSaving**s: A high-interest savings account is a savings account. Therefore, it inherits all the properties of a savings account. It also requires a minimum balance.
