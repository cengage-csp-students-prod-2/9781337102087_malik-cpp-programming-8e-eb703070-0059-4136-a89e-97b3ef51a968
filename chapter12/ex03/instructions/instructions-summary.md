## Instructions ##
Redo *Programming Exercise 7* of *Chapter 8* using dynamic arrays. The instructions have been posted for your convenience. You must ask the user for the number of candidates and then create the appropriate arrays to hold the data

Write a program that allows the user to enter the last names of five candidates in a local election and the number of votes received by each candidate. The program should then output each candidateâ€™s name, the number of votes received, and the percentage of the total votes received by the candidate. Your program should also output the winner of the election. A sample output is below:

Candidate | Votes Received | % of Total Votes
---------------|------------------------|-----------------------
Johnson |5000|25.91
Miller|4000|20.73
Duffy|6000|31.09
Robinson|2500|12.95
Ashtony|1800|9.33
Total |19300

The Winner of the Election is Duffy

> Format your output with `setprecision(2)` to ensure the proper number of decimals for testing!
