## Instructions
You are given a file consisting of students’ names in the following form: `lastName`, `firstName middleName`. (Note that a student may not have a middle name.) 

Write a program that converts each name to the following form: `firstName middleName lastName`. 

Your program must read each student’s entire name in a variable and must consist of a function that takes as input a string, consists of a student’s name, and returns the string consisting of the altered name to print to the terminal. 

Use the string function `find` to find the index of `,;` the function `length` to find the length of the string; and the function `substr` to extract the `firstName`, `middleName`, and `lastName`.
