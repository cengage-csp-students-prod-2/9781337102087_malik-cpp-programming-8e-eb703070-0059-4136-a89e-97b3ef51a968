## Instructions
** (Fraction calculator) **| Write a program that lets the user perform arithmetic operations on fractions. Fractions are of the form _a/b_, in which _a_ and _b_ are integers and _b &#8800; 0_. Your program must be menu driven, allowing the user to select the operation _(+, –, *, or /)_ and input the numerator and denominator of each fraction. Furthermore, your program must consist of at least the following functions:
* Function `menu`: This function informs the user about the program’s purpose, explains how to enter data, and allows the user to select the operation.
* Function `addFractions`: This function takes as input four integers representing the numerators and denominators of two fractions, adds the fractions, and returns the numerator and denominator of the result. (Notice that this function has a total of six parameters.)
* Function `subtractFractions`: This function takes as input four integers representing the numerators and denominators of two fractions, subtracts the fractions, and returns the numerator and denominator of the result. (Notice that this function has a total of six parameters.)
* Function `multiplyFractions`: This function takes as input four integers representing the numerators and denominators of two fractions, multiplies the fractions, and returns the numerators and denominators of the result. (Notice that this function has a total of six parameters.)
*	Function `divideFractions`: This function takes as input four integers representing the numerators and denominators of two fractions, divides the fractions, and returns the numerator and denominator of the result. (Notice that this function has a total of six parameters.)
Some sample outputs are:

 *  **3 / 4 + 2 / 5 = 23 / 20 **
 * **2 / 3 * 3 / 5 = 6 / 15**


Your answer need not be in the lowest terms.
