## Instructions
The Programming Example: Pig Latin Strings converts a string into the Pig Latin form, but it processes only one word. Rewrite the program so that it can be used to process a text of an unspecified length. If a word ends with a punctuation mark, in the pig Latin form, put the punctuation at the end of the string. For example, the pig Latin form of **Hello!** is **ello-Hay!**. Assume that the text contains the following punctuation marks:
* **,** (comma), 
* **.** (period), 
* **?** (question mark), 
* **;** (semicolon), 
* **:** (colon).

Store the output in Ch7_Ex3Out.txt.
