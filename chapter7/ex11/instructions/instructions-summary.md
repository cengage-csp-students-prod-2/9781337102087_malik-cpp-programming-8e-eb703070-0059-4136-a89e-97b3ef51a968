## Instructions
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string. The program outputs the sum of the values (collating sequence or ASCII value) of the characters in the string. For example, if the string is `"spring"`, then the sum of the values of the characters is **115 + 112 + 114 + 105 + 110 + 103 = 659**.
