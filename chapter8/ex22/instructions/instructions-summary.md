## Instructions
A positive integer `m` is called **composite** if `m = ab`, where `a` and `b` are positive integers such that a &#8800; 1 and b &#8800; 1. 

If `m` is composite, then `m` can be written as a product of prime numbers. Let `m` be an integer such that `2 ≤ m ≤ 100,000,000.`  If the integer entered is not within this range, continually prompt the user for an integer until one is provided. 

Modify the program in _Exercise 21_ so that if `m` is not prime, the program outputs `m` as a product of prime numbers. 

Code from *Exercise 21* has been included for you. 

Two examples of the program are shown below: 
```text
Enter an integer between 2 and 100,000,000: 22222

22222 is not a prime number.
22222 = 2 * 41 * 271
```

```
Enter an integer between 2 and 100,000,000: 11

11 is a prime number.
