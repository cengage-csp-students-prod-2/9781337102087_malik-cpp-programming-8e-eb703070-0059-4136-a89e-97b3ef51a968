## Summary
Children often play a memory game in which a deck of cards containing matching pairs is used. The cards are shuffled and placed face down on a table. The players then take turns and select two cards at a time. If both cards match, they are left face up; otherwise, the cards are placed face down at the same positions. Once the players see the selected pair of cards and if the cards do not match, then they can memorize the cards and use their memory to select the next pair of cards. The game continues until all the cards are face up. 
## Instructions
Write a program to play the memory game. Use a two-dimensional array of 4 rows and 4 columns for a deck of 16 cards with 8 matching pairs. You can use numbers 1 to 8 to mark the cards. (If you use a 6 by 6 array, then you will need 18 matching pairs, and so on.) Use random number generators to randomly store the pairs in the array. Use appropriate functions in your program, and the main program should be merely a call to functions.
