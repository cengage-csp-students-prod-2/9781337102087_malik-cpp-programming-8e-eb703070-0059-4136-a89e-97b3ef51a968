## Instructions
Write a program that randomly generates a 20 x 20 two-dimensional array, `board`, of type `int`. An element `board[i][j]` is a peak (either a maximum or a minimum) if all its neighbors (there should be either 3, 5, or 8 neighbors for any cell) are less than `board[i][j]`, or greater than `board[i][j`]. The program should output all elements in `board`, with their indices, which are peak. It should also output if a peak is a maximum or a minimum.
