## Instructions
Write a program to calculate students’ average test scores and their grades. You may assume the following input data:
```
	Johnson 85 83 77 91 76
	Aniston 80 90 95 93 48
	Cooper 78 81 11 90 73
	Gupta 92 83 30 69 87
	Blair 23 45 96 38 59
	Clark 60 85 45 39 67
	Kennedy 77 31 52 74 83
	Bronson 93 94 89 77 97
	Sunny 79 85 28 93 82
	Smith 85 72 49 75 63
```
Use three arrays: a one-dimensional array to store the students’ names, a (parallel) two-dimensional array to store the test scores, and a parallel one-dimensional array to store grades. 

Your program must contain at least the following functions: 
* a function to read and store data into two arrays
* a function to calculate the average test score and grade
* a function to output the results. 

Have your program also output the class average. 
Use the following scale to determine the letter grade: **90%–100%, A; 80%–89.99%, B; 70%–79.99%, C; 60%–69.99%, D; and 0%–59.99%, F **. 

> Format your output with `setprecision(2)` to ensure the proper number of decimals for testing!
