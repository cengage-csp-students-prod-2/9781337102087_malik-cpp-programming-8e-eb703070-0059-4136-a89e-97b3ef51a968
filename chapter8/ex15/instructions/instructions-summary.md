## Instructions
Redo _Programming Exercise 14_ by first sorting the array before determining the array elements that are the sum of two other elements. Use a selection sort algorithm, discussed in this chapter to sort the array. 

Instructions and code for **Programming Exercise 14** have been included for your convenience. 

### Exercise 14 ###
Write a program that prompts the user to enter 50 integers and stores them in an array. The program then determines and outputs which numbers in the array are sum of two other array elements. If an array element is the sum of two other array elements, then for this array element, the program should output all such pairs.
