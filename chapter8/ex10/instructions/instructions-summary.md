## Instructions
_Programming Exercise 12_ in _Chapter 6_ asks you find the mean and standard deviation of five numbers. Extend this programming exercise to find the mean and standard deviation of up to 100 numbers. Suppose that the mean (average) of _n_ numbers _x&#8321;, x&#8322; , . . ., xₙ is x_. Then the standard deviation of these numbers is:  
_s = √(((x&#8321;-x)²+(x&#8322;-x)²+ ···+(xᵢ-x)²+···(xₙ-x)²)/n)_

Code from *Programming Exercise 12* in *Chapter 6* has been included for you.
