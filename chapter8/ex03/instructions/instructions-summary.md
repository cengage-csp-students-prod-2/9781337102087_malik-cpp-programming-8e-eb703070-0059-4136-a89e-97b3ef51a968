## Instructions
Write a C++ function, `lastLargestIndex`, that takes as parameters an `int` array and its size and returns the index of the last occurrence of the largest element in the array. To test your function, write a `main` that prompts a user for a list of 15 integers and outputs the index and value of the first occurrence of the largest value. 

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter 15 integers: 
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
0
10
11
12
13
14
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 10 11 12 13 14 
The position of the first occurrence of the largest element in list is: 14
The largest element in list is: 14
```

You can use the following integer lists to test your code: 
* 56, 34, 67, 54, 56, 87, 66, 92, 15, 32, 55, 54, 88, 92, 30
* 79, 26, 79, 87, 73, 44, 67, 46, 55, 13, 20, 20, 33, 42, 60
* 63, 1, 40, 81, 30, 11, 26, 44, 98, 1, 80, 98, 15, 3, 42
