## Instructions

Consider the provided function `main` in _main.cpp_:

- Write the definition of the function `inputArray` that prompts the user to input 20 numbers and stores the numbers into `alpha`.
- Write the definition of the function `doubleArray` that initializes the elements of beta to two times the corresponding elements in `alpha`. Make sure that you prevent the function from modifying the elements of `alpha`.
- Write the definition of the function `copyAlphaBeta` that stores `alpha` into the first five rows of `matrix` and `beta` into the last five rows of `matrix`. Make sure that you prevent the function from modifying the elements of `alpha` and `beta`.
- Write the definition of the function `printArray` that prints any one-dimensional array of type `int`. Print 15 elements per line.
- Write a C++ program that tests the function main and the functions discussed in the parts above. (Add additional functions, such as printing a two-dimensional array, as needed.)
