## Instructions
Write a program that uses a 3 x 3 array and randomly place each integer from 1 to 9 into the nine squares. The program calculates the magic number by adding all the numbers in the array and then dividing the sum by 3. The 3x3 array is a magic square if the sum of each row, each column, and each diagonal is equal to the magic number. 

Your program must contain at least the following functions: a function to randomly fill the array with the numbers and a function to determine if the array is a magic square. Run these functions for some large number of times, say 1,000, 10,000, or 1,000,000, and see the number of times the array is a magic square.
