## Instructions
Write a program that uses a two-dimensional array to store the highest and lowest temperatures for each month of the year. The program should output the average high, average low, and the highest and lowest temperatures for the year. 

Your program must consist of the following functions:
* Function `getData`: This function reads and stores data in the two-dimensional array.
* Function `averageHigh`: This function calculates and returns the average high temperature for the year.
* Function `averageLow`: This function calculates and returns the average low temperature for the year.
* Function `indexHighTemp`: This function returns the index of the highest high temperature in the array.
* Function `indexLowTemp`: This function returns the index of the lowest low temperature in the array.

>These functions must all have the appropriate parameters. 

An example of the program is shown below: 

```text
