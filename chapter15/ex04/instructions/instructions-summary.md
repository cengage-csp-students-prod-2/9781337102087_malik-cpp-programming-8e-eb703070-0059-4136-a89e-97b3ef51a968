## Instructions ##

Write a recursive function named `sumSquares` that returns the sum of the squares of the numbers from **0** to **num**, in which `num` is a nonnegative `int` variable. Do not use global variables; use the appropriate parameters. Also write a program to test your function that outputs the result to the terminal.
