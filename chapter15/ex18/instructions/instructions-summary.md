## Instructions ##
The sequential search algorithm given in *Chapter 8* (provided) is nonrecursive. Write and implement a recursive version of the sequential search algorithm. Your program should prompt the user to search the list for an integer to search for in the list. Use the following the array of digits:

      2, 6, 8, 23, 45, 43, 51, 62, 83, 78, 61, 8, 71, 34, 72

if a match is found, output the index where the element was found. 

If the integer is not in the array, output the following message:

     x is not in the list


The user should be able to run the program more than once by entering `Y`, `y` or `N`, `n` to end the program.
