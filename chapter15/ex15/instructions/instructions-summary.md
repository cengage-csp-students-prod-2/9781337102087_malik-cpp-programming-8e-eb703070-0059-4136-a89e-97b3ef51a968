## Instructions ##
Write a recursive function to implement the recursive algorithm of *Exercise 17*  (multiplying two positive integers using repeated addition). Also, write a program to test your function. Your program should prompt the user for the two integers to be multiplied and output the results to the terminal. The instructions from *Exercise 17* have been included below for your convenience:

Write a recursive algorithm to multiply two positive integers `m `and `n` using repeated addition. Specify the base case and the recursive case.
