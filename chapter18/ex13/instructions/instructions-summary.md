## Instructions
This chapter describes the array implementation of queues that use a special array slot, called the reserved slot, to distinguish between an empty and a full queue. 

Write the definition of the class and the definitions of the function members of this queue design. 

Also, write a program (in *main.cpp*) to test various operations on a queue.
