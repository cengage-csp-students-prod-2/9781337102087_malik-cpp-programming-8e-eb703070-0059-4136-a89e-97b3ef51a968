## Summary
The implementation of a queue in an array, as given in this chapter, uses the variable `count` to determine whether the queue is empty or full. You can also use the variable `count` to return the number of elements in the queue. 

On the other hand, `class` `linkedQueueType` does not use such a variable to keep track of the number of elements in the queue. 

## Instructions
Redefine the class `linkedQueueType` by adding the variable `count` to keep track of the number of elements in the queue. 

Modify the definitions of the functions `addQueue` and `deleteQueue` as necessary. 

Add the function `queueCount` to return the number of elements in the queue. 

Also, write a program (in *main.cpp*) to test various operations you defined for the class.
