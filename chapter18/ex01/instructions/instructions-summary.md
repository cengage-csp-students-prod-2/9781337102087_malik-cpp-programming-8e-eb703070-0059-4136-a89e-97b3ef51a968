## Instructions
Two stacks of the same type are the same if they have the same number of elements and their elements at the corresponding positions are the same. 

Overload the relational operator `==` for the `class` `stackType` that returns `true` if two stacks of the same type are the same; it returns `false` otherwise. 

Also, write the definition of the function template to overload this operator.

Write a program to test the various overloaded operators and functions of `class` `stackType`.
