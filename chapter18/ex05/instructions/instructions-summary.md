## Instructions
Write a program that takes as input an arithmetic expression followed by a semicolon `;`.

The program outputs whether the expression contains matching grouping symbols. 

For example, the arithmetic expressions `{25 + (3 â€“ 6) * 8}` and `7 + 8 * 2` contains matching grouping symbols. 

However, the expression `5 + {(13 + 7) / 8 - 2 * 9` does not contain matching grouping symbols.

If the expression contains matching grouping symbols, the program output should contain the following text:
```
Expression has matching grouping symbol
```
If the expression does not contain matching grouping symbols, the program output should contain the following text:
```
Expression does not have matching grouping symbols.
```
