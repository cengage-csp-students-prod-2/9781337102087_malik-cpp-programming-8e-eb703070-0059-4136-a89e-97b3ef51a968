## Instructions
Write a program that reads a line of text, changes each uppercase letter to lowercase, and places each letter both in a queue and onto a stack.

The program should then verify whether the line of text is a palindrome (a set of letters or numbers that is the same whether read forward or backward).

If the input text is a palindrome, the program should print **The line of text you entered is a palindrome**.

If the input text is not a palindrome, the program should print **The line of text you entered is not a palindrome**.
