## Instructions
Write the definition of the function `moveNthFront` that takes as a parameter a positive integer, *n*. 

The function moves the *n*th element of the queue to the front. The order of the remaining elements remains unchanged.

For example, suppose:

*queue = {5, 11, 34, 67, 43, 55}* and *n = 3*.

After a call to the function `moveNthFront`:

*queue = {34, 5, 11, 67, 43, 55}*

Add this function to the `class` `queueType`.

Also, write a program (in *main.cpp*) to test your method.
