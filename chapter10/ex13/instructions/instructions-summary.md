## Instructions
In this exercise, you will design the `class memberType`.
1. Each object of `memberType` can hold the name of a person, member ID, number of books bought, and amount spent.
2. Include the member functions to perform the various operations on the objects of `memberType`—for example, modify, set, and show a person’s name. Similarly, up-date, modify, and show the number of books bought and the amount spent.
3. Add the appropriate constructors.
4. Write the definitions of the member functions of `memberType`.
5. Write a program to test various operations of your `class memberType`.

> Your program must include the following member functions:
'isMemberID' to show which member has a certain ID;
'getBooksPurchased' get the number of books purchased by a member;
'getTotalAmountSpent' to show the total amount spent by a member;
'purchaseBook' retrieves to total amount spent and the amount of the new purchase;
'resetbooksBoughtAndAmount' to to reset both the number of books purchased and total amount spent by a member.
