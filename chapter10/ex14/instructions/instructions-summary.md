## Summary

Using the classes designed in _Programming Exercises 12 _ and _13_, write a program to simulate a bookstore. The bookstore has two types of customers: those who are members of the bookstore and those who buy books from the bookstore only occasionally. Each member must pay a $10 yearly membership fee and receives a 5% discount on each book purchased. For each member, the bookstore keeps track of the number of books purchased and the total amount spent. For every eleventh book that a member buys, the bookstore takes the average of the total amount of the last 10 books purchased, applies this amount as a discount, and then resets the total amount spent to **0**.

## Instructions

Write a program that can process up to 1,000 book titles and 500 members. Your program should contain a menu that gives the user different choices to effectively run the program; in other words, your program should be user driven.
