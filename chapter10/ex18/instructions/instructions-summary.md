## Instructions
The equation of a line in standard form is _ax + by = c_ , wherein both `a `and `b` cannot be zero, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are real numbers. If b&#8800;0, then _–a/b_ is the slope of the line. If _a = 0_, then it is a horizontal line, and if _b = 0_, then it is a vertical line. The slope of a vertical line is undefined. Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope or both are vertical lines. Two lines are perpendicular if either one of the lines is horizontal and the other is vertical or the product of their slopes is –1. Design the `class lineType` to store a line. 

To store a line, you need to store the values of `a` (coefficient of x), `b` (coefficient of y), and `c`. Your `class` must contain the following operations:
* If a line is nonvertical, then determine its slope.
* Determine if two lines are equal. (Two lines a&#8321;x + b&#8321;y = c&#8321;  and a&#8322;x + b&#8322;y = c&#8322;  are equal if either a&#8321; = a&#8322;, b&#8321; = b&#8322;, and c&#8321; = c&#8322;, or a&#8321; = ka&#8322;, b&#8321; = kb&#8322; and c&#8321; = kc&#8322;, and   for some real number `k`.)
* Determine if two lines are parallel.
* Determine if two lines are perpendicular.
* If two lines are not parallel, then print the point of intersection. 

The intersection method should indicate one of three options:  
> The intersection point in the format: **(x, y)** .
> A message indicating **Both lines are equal**.
> A message indicating the **Lines do not intersect**.

Add appropriate constructors to initialize variables of `lineType`. 
Also, write a program to test your `class`.

> Make sure you are checking your work by running the tasks throughout your development process.
