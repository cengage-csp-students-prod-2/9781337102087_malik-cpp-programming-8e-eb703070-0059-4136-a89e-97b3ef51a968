## Instructions
_Example 10-10_ defined a `class personType` to store the name of a person. The member functions that we included merely print the name and set the name of a person. Redefine the `class personType` so that, in addition to what the existing `class` does, you can:
* Set the first name only.
* Set the last name only.
* Store and set the middle name.
* Check whether a given first name is the same as the first name of this person.
* Check whether a given last name is the same as the last name of this person. 

Write the definitions of the member functions to implement the operations for this `class`. Also, write a program to test various operations on this `class`.
