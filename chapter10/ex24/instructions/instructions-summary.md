## Instructions
Write the definitions of the member functions of the `class integerManipulation` not given in _Example 10-11_. Also, add the following operations to this class: 
1. Split the number into blocks of n-digit numbers starting from right to left and find the sum of these n-digit numbers. (Note that the last block may not have `n` digits. If needed add additional instance variables.) 
2. Determine the number of zeroes. 
3. Determine the number of even digits. 
4. Determine the number of odd digits

Also, write a program to test the`class` `integerManipulation`.

The header file for `class` `integerManipulation` has been provided for you.
