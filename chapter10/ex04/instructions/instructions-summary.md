## Instructions
Define a `class` `counterType` to implement a counter. Your class must have a private data member `counter` of type `int`. Define a constructor that accepts a parameter of type `int` and initializes the `counter` data member. Add functions to:

* Set `counter` to the integer value specified by the user.
* Initialize `counter` to **0**.
* Return the value of **counter** with a function named `getCounter`.
* Increment and decrement **counter** by one.
* Print the value of **counter** using the `print` function.
	* Example output: `Counter = 0`.

The value of **counter** must be nonnegative.
