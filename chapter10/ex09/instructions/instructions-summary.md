## Instructions
 
This chapter defines the `class clockType` to implement time in a program. Add functions to this `class` so that a program that uses this `class` can set only the hours, minutes, or seconds and retrieve only the hours, minutes, or seconds. Make the functions that retrieve hours, minutes, and seconds as inline. Also, write a program to test your `class`.

The header file for the `class` `clockType`, as it is defined in this chapter, has been provided for you.
