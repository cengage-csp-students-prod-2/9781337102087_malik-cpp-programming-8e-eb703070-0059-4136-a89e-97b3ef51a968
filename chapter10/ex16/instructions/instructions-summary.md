## Instructions
Write the definition of a `class swimmingPool`, to implement the properties of a swimming pool. Your class should have the instance variables to store the length (in feet), width (in feet), depth (in feet), the rate (in gallons per minute) at which the water is filling the pool, and the rate (in gallons per minute) at which the water is draining from the pool. Add appropriate constructors to initialize the instance variables. 

Also, add member functions to do the following: determine the amount of water needed to fill an empty or partially filled pool, determine the time needed to completely or partially fill or empty the pool, and add or drain water for a specific amount of time, if the water in the pool exceeds the total capacity of the pool, output "**Pool overflow**" to indicate that the water has breached capacity. The header file for the `swimmingPool` class has been provided for reference.

Write a program to test your `swimmingPool` class. 

An example of the program is shown below:
```text
Pool data: 
  Length: 30
  Width: 15
  Depth: 10
  Total water in the pool: 0
  To completely fill the pool: 
  Enter water fill-in rate: 10 

  Time to fill the pool is approximately: 56 hour(s) and 6 minute(s).

```
