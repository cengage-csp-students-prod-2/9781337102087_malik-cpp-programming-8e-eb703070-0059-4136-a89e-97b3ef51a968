## Instructions
Write a program to illustrate how to use the `temporary` class, designed in _Exercises 13_ and *14* of this chapter.  Your program must contain statements that would ask the user to enter data of an object and use the setters to initialize the object. 

The header file for the `class` `temporary` from *Exercise 13* has been provided. 

An example of the program is shown below: 
```text
Enter object name (rectangle, circle, sphere, or cylinder: circle

Enter object's dimensions: 
    rectangle (length and width) 
    circle (radius and 0) 
    sphere (radius and 0) 
    rectangle (base raidus and height) 
10
0


After setting myObject: 
circle: radius = 10.00, area = 314.16

```
