## Instructions

_Programming Exercise 22_ prompted the user to input the number of times the dice were to be rolled and the desired sum, and the program output the number of times the desired sum occurred.

Modify _Programming Exercise 22_ as follows: Suppose you roll 4 dice 1000 times. Store the sum of the numbers rolled in each roll into an array and then use this array to print a bar graph similar to the bar graph in _Programming Example Data Comparison (Chapter 6)_ at the end of the program.

Test run your program using 4, 5, and 6 dice and the number of rolls 2500, 3000, and 5000. Run this numbers multipe times and observe the outputs. What type of curve does the shape of your bar graph resemble?
