## Instructions
Enhance _Programming Exercise 9_ by adding the functions below to the `class clockType` so that a program that uses this class can perform the following operations:

* `timeElapsed` -  returns the elapsed time of the day of a clock in seconds.
* `timeRemaining` - returns the remaining time of the day of a clock in seconds.
* `timeDifference` - determines and returns how far apart in time two clocks are in seconds. This function takes another `clockType` class as an argument. 

Also, write a program to test your `clockType` implementation.
