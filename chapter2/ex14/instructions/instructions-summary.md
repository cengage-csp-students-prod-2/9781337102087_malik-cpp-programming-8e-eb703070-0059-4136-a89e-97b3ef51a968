## Summary 
If you buy a 40 GB hard drive, then chances are that the actual storage on the hard drive is not 40 GB. This is due to the fact that, typically, a manufacturer uses 1,000 bytes as the value of 1kilobyte(KB), 1,000 KB as the value of 1 megabyte(MB), 1,000 MB as the value of 1 gigbyte(GB). Therefore, a 40 GB hard drive contains 40,000,000,000 bytes. 

However, in computer memory, as given in *Table 1-1 (Chapter 1)*, 1 KB is equal to 1,024 bytes, and so on. So the actual storage on a 40 GB hard drive is approximately 37.25 GB. (You might like to read the fine print next time you buy a hard drive.)

## Instructions
Write a program that:
1. Prompts the user to enter the size of the hard drive in GB as specified by the manufacturer.You can get this information from the hard drive box.
2. Outputs the actual storage capacity of the hard drive in GB based on the above information.
