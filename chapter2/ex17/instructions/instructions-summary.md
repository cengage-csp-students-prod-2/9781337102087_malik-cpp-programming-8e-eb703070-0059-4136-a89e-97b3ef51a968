## Instructions
A milk carton can hold 3.78 liters of milk. Each morning, a dairy farm ships cartons of milk to a local grocery store. The cost of producing one liter of milk and the profit of each carton of milk vary from farm to farm. 

Write a program that prompts the user to enter:

1. The total amount of milk produced in the morning.

2. The cost of producing one liter of milk.

3. The profit on each carton of milk. 

The program then outputs:
1. The number of milk cartons needed to hold milk.

2. The cost of producing milk.

3. The profit for producing milk.
