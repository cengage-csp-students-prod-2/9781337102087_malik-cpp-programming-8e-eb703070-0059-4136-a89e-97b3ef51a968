## Instructions
Write a program to implement and test the algorithm that you designed for *Exercise 15* of *Chapter 1*. The instructions to *Exercise 15* have been posted below for your convenience:

### Exercise 15 ###
*Given the radius, in inches, and the price of a pizza, design an algorithm to find the price of the pizza per square inch.*

You may assume that the value of Ï€ = **3.141593**.

In your program, declare a named constant `PI` to store this value. 
 
Below is an example of the output of the completed program should look: 
```
Enter the radius of the pizza: 20

Enter the price of the pizza: 22

The price per square inch is: 0.017507
```

> Since your program handles currency, make sure to use a data type that can store decimals.
