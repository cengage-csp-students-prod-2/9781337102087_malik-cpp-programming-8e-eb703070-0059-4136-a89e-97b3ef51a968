## Summary
You found an exciting summer job for five weeks. It pays, say, $15.50 per hour. Suppose that the total tax you pay on your summer job income is 14%. 

After paying the taxes, you spend
10% of your net income to buy new clothes and other accessories for the next school year
and 1% to buy school supplies. 

After buying clothes and school supplies, you use 25% of the
remaining money to buy savings bonds. For each dollar you spend to buy savings bonds,
your parents spend $0.50 to buy additional savings bonds for you.

## Instructions
Write a program that prompts the user to enter:
1. The pay rate per hour and the number of hours you worked each week.

The program then outputs the following:

1. Your income before and after taxes from your summer job.

2. The amount of money you spend on clothes and other accessories.

3. The amount of money you spend on school supplies.

4. The amount of money you spend to buy savings bonds for yourself.

5. The amount of money your parents spend to buy additional savings bonds for you.
