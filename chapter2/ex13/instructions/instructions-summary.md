## Instructions
To make a profit, a local store marks up the prices of its items by a certain percentage. 

Write a C++ program that reads: 
1. The original price of the item sold.
2. The percentage of the marked-up price.
3. The sales tax rate. 

The program then outputs:
1. The original price of the item.
2. The percentage of the mark-up.
3. The storeâ€™s selling price of the item.
4. The sales tax rate.
5. The sales tax.
6. The final price of the item.
    * (The final price of the item is the selling price plus the sales tax.)

> Since your program handles currency, make sure to use a data type that can store decimals. 

An example of the program is shown below:
```text
Enter the original price of the item: 100

Enter the marked up percentage: 20

Enter the sales tax rate: 8

The original price = $100
The price is marked up by 20%
The selling price = $120
The sales rate = 8%
The sales tax = $9.6
The final price = $129.6
```
