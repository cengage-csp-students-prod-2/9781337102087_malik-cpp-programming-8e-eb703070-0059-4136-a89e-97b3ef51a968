## Instructions
Consider the following program segment:
```cpp
//include statement(s)
//using namespace statement

int main()
{
	//variable declaration

	//executable statements

	//return statement
}
```
1. Write C++ statements that include the `iostream` and `string` header files.

2. Write a C++ statement that allows you to use `cin`, `cout`, and `endl` without the prefix `std::`.

3.Write the C++ statements that declare the following variables: `name` of type `string` and `studyHours` of type `double`.

4. Write the C++ statements that prompts the user for input. Store a string into variable `name` and a `double` value into the `studyHours` variable.

5. Write a C++ statement that outputs the values of `name` and `studyHours` with the appropriate variable value and required text.
