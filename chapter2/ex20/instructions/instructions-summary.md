## Summary
For each used car a salesperson sells, the commission is paid as follows: $20 plus 30% of the selling price in excess of the cost of the car. 

Typically, the minimum selling price of the car is the cost of the car plus $200 and the maximum selling price is the cost of the car plus $2,000. 

## Instructions
Write a program that prompts the user to enter:

1. Purchasing cost of the car.
2. The minimum to be added to the purchasing cost.
3. The maximum to be added to the purchasing cost.
4. Salesperson’s fixed commission.
5. Percentage of the commission.

The program should output:
1. The minimum and maximum selling price of the car.
2. The salesperson’s commission range.

> Since your program handles currency, make sure to use a data type that can store decimals.
