## Summary
Newtonâ€™s law states that the force, *F*, between two bodies of masses *M<sub>1</sub>* and *M<sub>2</sub>* is given by:

in which *k* is the gravitational constant and *d* is the distance between the bodies. The value of *k* is approximately *6.67 X 10<sup>-8</sup> dyn. cm&#178;/g&#178;* . 

## Instructions
Write a program that prompts the user to input:
1. The masses of the two bodies.
2. The distance between the two bodies. 

The program then outputs:
1. The force between the bodies.

> Your program should be able to work with decimals.
