## Instructions
You are trying to make ASCII art. Write a program that produces the following output:

```
CCCCCCCCC       ++              ++
CC              ++              ++
CC        ++++++++++++++  +++++++++++++++
CC        ++++++++++++++  +++++++++++++++
CC              ++              ++
CCCCCCCCC       ++              ++
```
Note: The letter **C** in the output must be uppercase. There is one column of space between the "C" and the first plus symbol and two columns of space between the two plus symbols.
