## Instructions
Consider the following C++ program in which the statements are in the incorrect order.

Rearrange the statements so that it prompts the user to input the radius of a circle first, and then outputs the area and circumference of the circle.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

{

int main()

cout << "Enter the radius: ";

cin >> radius;

cout << endl;

double radius;
double area;

using namespace std;

return 0;

cout << "Area = " << area << endl;

area = PI * radius * radius;

circumference = 2 * PI * radius;

cout << "Circumference = " << circumference << endl;

const double PI = 3.14;

double circumference;
}
```
