## Instructions

Consider the following program segment:

```cpp
//include statement(s)
//using namespace statement

int main()
{
//variable declaration

//executable statements

//return statement
}
```

1. Write a C++ statement that includes the `iostream` header file, and allows you to use cin, cout, and endl without the prefix `std::`.

2. Write C++ statements that declare the following variables: `num1`, `num2`, `num3` , and `average` of type **double**.

3. Write C++ statements that store 75.35 into `num1`, -35.56 into `num2`, and 15.76 into `num3`.

4. Write a C++ statement that stores the average of `num1`, `num2`, and `num3` as the variable `average`.

5. Write C++ statement(s) that output the values of `num1`, `num2`, `num3`, and `average`.
