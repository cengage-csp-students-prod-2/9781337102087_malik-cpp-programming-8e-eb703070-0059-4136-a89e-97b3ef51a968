## Summary
Cindy uses the services of a brokerage firm to buy and sell stocks. The firm charges 1.5% service charges on the total amount for each transaction, buy or sell. When Cindy sells stocks, she would like to know if she gained or lost on a particular investment.

## Instructions
Write a program that allows Cindy to input:
1. The purchase price of each share.
2. The selling price of each share.
3. The number of shares sold.

The program outputs:
1. The total amount invested.
2. The total amount received from selling.
3. The total service charges.
4. Amount gained or lost.

An example program is shown below: 
```
Enter the buying price of each share: 13.23

Enter the selling price of each share: 14.00

Enter the number of shares sold: 43

Total amount invested: $ 577.423
Total amount received: $ 592.97
Total service charges: $ 17.5633
Amount gained or lost: $15.5466
```

> Since your program handles currency, make sure to use a data type that can store decimals.
