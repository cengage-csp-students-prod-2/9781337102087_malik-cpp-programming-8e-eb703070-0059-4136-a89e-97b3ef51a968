}
```
1. Write a C++ statement that includes the `iostream` header file.
2. Include the standard namespace.
3. Declare four integer type variables: num1, num2, num3, average.
4. Store the following values in the assigned variables: num1 = 125, num2 = 28, num3 = -25, average = 0.
5. Calculate the average of the three variables and store this value in the average variable.
