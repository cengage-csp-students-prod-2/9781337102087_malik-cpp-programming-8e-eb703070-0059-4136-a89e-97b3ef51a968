## Instructions
The `class dateType` defined in _Programming Exercise 6_ prints the date in numerical form. Some applications might require the date to be printed in another form, such as March 24, 2019. Derive the `class extDateType` so that the date can be printed in either form.

Add a member variable to the `class extDateType` so that the month can also be stored in string form. Add a member function to output the month in the string format, followed by the yearâ€”for example, in the form March 2019. 

Write the definitions of the functions to implement the operations for the `class extDateType`. 

*Note: you may write a* `main.cpp` *to test your class but will not be graded on the* `main.cpp`.
