## Instructions
Using classes, design an online address book to keep track of the names, addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth of family members, close friends, and certain business associates. Your program should be able to handle a maximum of 500 entries.
1. Define a `class addressType` that can store a street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Use the appropriate functions to print and store the address. Also, use constructors to automatically initialize the member variables.

1. Define a `class extPersonType` using the `class personType` (as defined in _Example 10-10, Chapter 10_), the `class dateType `(as designed in this chapter’s _Programming Exercise 2_), and the `class addressType`. Add a member variable to this class to classify the person as a family member, friend, or business associate. Also, add a member variable to store the phone number. Add (or override) the functions to print and store the appropriate information. Use constructors to automatically initialize the member variables.

1. Define the class `addressBookType` using the previously defined classes. An object of the type `addressBookType` should be able to process a maximum of 500 entries.


The program should perform the following operations:  

* Load the data into the address book from a disk (`Ch11_Ex5Data.txt`).
* Sort the address book by last name.
* Search for a person by last name (option **1**).
* Print the address, phone number, and date of birth (if it exists) of a given person (option **2**).
* Print the names of the people whose birthdays are in a given month (option **3**).
* Print the names of all the people between two last names (option **4**).
* Depending on the user’s request, print the names of all family members, friends, or business associates (option **5**).
* Print the entire address book (option **6**). 
* Save the sorted address book to a file (option **7**).
* Terminate the program (option **9**). 

An example of the program is shown below:
