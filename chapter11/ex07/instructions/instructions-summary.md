## Instructions
Write the definitions of the functions to implement the operations defined for the `class dateType` in _Programming Exercise 6_.

You may write a `main.cpp` to test your class `dateType`. 
You will only be graded on the contents of the  `dateType` class. Make sure your dates are formatted *MM-DD-YYYY*.
