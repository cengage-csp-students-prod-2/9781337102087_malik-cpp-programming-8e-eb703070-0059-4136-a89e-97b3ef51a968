## Summary
Let *l* be a line in the *x-y* plane. If *l* is a vertical line, its equation is *x = a* for some real number *a*. 

Suppose *l* is not a vertical line and its slope is *m*. Then the equation of *l* is *y = mx + b*, where *b* is the *y*-intercept. 

If *l* passes through the point *(x&#8320;, y&#8320;)*, the equation of *l* can be written as *y - y&#8320; = m(x - x&#8320;)*. 

If *(x&#8321;, y&#8321;)* and *(x&#8322;, y&#8322;)* are two points in the *x-y* plane and x&#8321; &#8800; x&#8322;, the slope of line passing through these points is *m = (y&#8322; - y&#8321;)/(x&#8322; - x&#8321;)*.

## Instructions

Write a program that prompts the user for two points in the *x-y* plane.
Input should be entered in the following order:
* Input x&#8321;
* Input y&#8321;
* Input x&#8322;
* Input y&#8322;

The program:
1. Outputs the equation of the line
2. Uses `if` statements to determine and output whether the line is vertical, horizontal, increasing, or decreasing. 

If *l* is a non-vertical line, output its equation in the form *y = mx + b*.

Note: Output all numbers with a precision of two decimal places.
