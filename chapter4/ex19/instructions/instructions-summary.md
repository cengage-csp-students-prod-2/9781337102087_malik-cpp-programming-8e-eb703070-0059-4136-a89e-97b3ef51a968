Ron bought several acres of farm to grow and sell vegetables. Suppose that Ron wants to grow a maximum of two types of vegetables. 

Write a program that prompts Ron or the user to do the following:

1. Enter the total farm area in acres.
2. The number of vegetables (one or two) that the user wants to grow.
3. If the user wants to grow two types of vegetables, then prompt the user to enter the portion (as a percentage) of land used for the first vegetable.
4. Enter the seed cost, plantation cost, fertilizing cost, labor cost, and selling price per acre.
5. If the user specified two vegetables, prompt the user to enter the items in step 4 for the second vegetable.
