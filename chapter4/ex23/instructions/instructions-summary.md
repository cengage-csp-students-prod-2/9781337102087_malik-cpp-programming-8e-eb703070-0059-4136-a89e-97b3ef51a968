## Summary
The screen size of a TV is given by the length of the rectangular diagonal. 

Traditional TVs come in 4:3 ratio, that is, the ratio of length to width is 4 to 3. This means, if the length is *x* inches, then the width is (3/4)*x*. 

LCD TVs come in 16:9 ratio. 

## Instructions
Write a program that:
1. Prompts the user to input the length of the diagonal (in inches) of the screen.
2. Allows the user to select which type of TV the user would like to view the dimensions for.
 * Ex. 
```
1: Traditional TV area.
2: LCD TV Area.
3: Both types of TVs area.
```

Have the program calculate and display the:
1. Screen length
2. Screen width
3. Screen area 

for the specified type of TV.
