## Instructions
The statements in the file *main.cpp* are in an incorrect order. 

Rearrange the statements so that they prompt the user to input:
* The shape type (rectangle, circle, or cylinder) 
* The appropriate dimension of the shape.

> Note: For grading purposes place the cylinder height statement before the radius statement.

The program then outputs the following information about the shape: 
* For a rectangle, it outputs the area and perimeter 
* For a circle, it outputs the area and circumference
* For a cylinder, it outputs the volume and surface area.

> Use **3.1416** as the constant value for any calculations that may need `$\pi$`.

After rearranging the statements, your program should be properly indented.
