## Instructions
Write a program that mimics a calculator. The program should take as input:
1. Two floating-point numbers.
2. The operation to be performed (+, -, /, *). 

It should then output the numbers, the operator, and the result. 

Additional notes:
* Format your output to two decimal places.
* For division, if the denominator is zero, output an appropriate message.  The message should contain the word "**error**".

Some sample outputs follow:
```
3.5 + 4.0 = 7.50
13.973 * 5.65 = 78.95
```
