## Instructions
Write a program that mimics a calculator. The program should take as input:
1. The first integer.
2. The second integer.
3. The operation to be performed (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).

It should then output the numbers, the operator, and the result. (For division, if the denominator is zero, output an appropriate message.  The message should contain the word "**error**"). 

Some sample outputs follow:
```
3 + 4 = 7
13 * 5 = 65
```
