## Instructions ##
Write a version of the binary search algorithm that can be used to search a string vector object. Also, write a program to test your algorithm. (Use the selection sort algorithm you developed in *Programming Exercise 12* to sort the vector.) Your program should prompt the user to input a series of strings, ending the input stream with **zzz**. The program should then prompt the user to search for a specific `string` in the list.

If the `string` is found in the list:
''''
x is found in the list
''''
else:
''''
x is not in the list
''''
