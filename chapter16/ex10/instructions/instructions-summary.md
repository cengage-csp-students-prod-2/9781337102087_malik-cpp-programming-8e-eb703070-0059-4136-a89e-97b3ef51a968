## Instructions ##
Write a version of the sequential search algorithm that can be used to search a `string` `vector` object. Also, write a program to test your algorithm. The program should prompt the user for a series of names. The `string` **zzz** should end the input stream and prompt the user to search the list. 

If the search is successful, output:
''''
x is found in the list
''''
else:
''''
x is not in the list
''''
