## Instructions ##
Write a program that creates three identical arrays, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` of **5,000** elements. The program then sorts `list1` using `bubbleSort`, `list2` using `selectionSort`, and `list3` using `insertionSort` and outputs the number of comparisons and item assignments made by each sorting algorithm.
