## Instructions ##
Write a function, `insertAt`, that takes four parameters: an array of integers, the number of elements in the array, an integer (say, `insertItem`), and an integer (say, `index`). 

The function should insert `insertItem` in the array provided at the position specified by `index`.

If `index` is out of range, output the following:
''''
Position of the item to be inserted is out of range
''''
If the index is negative:
''''
Position of the item to be inserted must be nonnegative
''''

*(Note that `index` must be between **0** and the number of elements in the array; that is, **0 <= index < the number of elements in the array**.)* Assume that the array is unsorted.
