## Instructions ##
Write a program to test the function you designed in *Exercise 12* to improve the performance of bubble sort. The instructions have been included for your convenience. 

It was remarked in this chapter that the performance of bubble sort can be improved if we stop the sorting process as soon as we find that in an iteration no swapping of elements take place. Write a function that implements bubble sort algorithm using this fact.

Using the algorithm that you designed above, find the number of iterations that are needed to sort the list: **65, 34, 52, 43, 75, 5, 80, 90, 95**.
