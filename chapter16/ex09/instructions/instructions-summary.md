## Instructions ##

Write a version of the binary search algorithm that can be used to search a list of strings.
(Use the selection sort that you designed in *Exercise 8* to sort the list.) 

Write a program to test the function and prompt the user to enter 10 strings. 

The program should output the position of the `string` if found in the list with the following message:
''''
z is found at position 1
''''

and the following message if not: 

''''
x is not in the list
''''
