## Instructions ##
Write a program to test the function `binarySearch`. 

Use either the function `bubbleSort` or `insertionSort` to sort the list before the search.  

Your program should prompt the user to enter 10 digits and then prompt the user to enter a digit to search.

If the list contains this digit, output its position to the console:
''''
x is found at position y
''''

If the digit is not contained in the list, output the following: 
''''
x is not in the list
''''
