## Instructions ##
Write a program to test the function you designed in *Exercise 16*. The instructions have been included below for your convenience.

### Exercise 16
Suppose that the elements of a list are in descending order and they need to be put in ascending order. Write a C++ function that takes as input an array of items in descending order and the number or elements in the array. The function rearranges the element of the array in ascending order. Your function should not incorporate any sorting algorithms, that is, no item comparisons should take place.

Use the following set of integers to test the function **125, 100, 94, 88, 75, 71, 66, 58, 53, 37, 32, 28, 14, 10, 8** and output the new list to the console.
