## Instructions ##
Your state is in a process of creating a weekly lottery. Once a week, five distinct random integers between 1 and 40 (inclusive) are drawn. If a player guesses all of the numbers correctly, the player wins a certain amount. Write a program that does the following:

1. Generates five distinct random numbers between 1 and 40 (inclusive) and stores them in an `array`.
2. Sorts the `array` containing the lottery numbers.
3. Prompts the player to select five distinct integers between 1 and 40 (inclusive) and stores the numbers in an `array`. The player can select the numbers in any order, and the `array` containing the numbers need not be sorted.
4. Determines whether the player guessed the lottery numbers correctly. If the player guessed the lottery numbers correctly, it outputs the message **You win!**; otherwise it outputs the message **You lose!** and outputs the lottery numbers.

Your program should allow a player to play the game as many times as the player wants to play. Before each play, generate a new set of lottery numbers.
