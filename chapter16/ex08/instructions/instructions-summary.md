## Instructions ##
Write a version of the selection sort algorithm that can be used to sort a list of strings alphabetically. (Selection sort for `int` lists is discussed in *Chapter 8*.) 

Write a program to test the function and prompt the user to enter 10 strings. Output the sorted list to the console.
