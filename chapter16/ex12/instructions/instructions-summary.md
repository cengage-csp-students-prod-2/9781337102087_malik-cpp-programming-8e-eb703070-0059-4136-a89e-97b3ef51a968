## Instructions ##
Write a version of the selection sort algorithm in a function called `selectionSort` that can be used to sort a `string` `vector` object. Also, write a program to test your algorithm. The program should prompt the user for a series of names. The `string` **zzz** should end the input stream. Output the sorted list to the console.
