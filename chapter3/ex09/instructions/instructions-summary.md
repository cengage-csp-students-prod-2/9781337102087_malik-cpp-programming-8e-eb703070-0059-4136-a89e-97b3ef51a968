## Instructions
Dairy Farm Inc. has decided to ship their milk in containers in the form of a cube rather than cylinders.

Write a program that prompts the user to input:
1. The radius of the base of a cylindrical container.
2. The height of the cylindrical container.

The program then outputs:
1. The side of the cube with the same volume as the cylindrical container with a precision of 2 decimal places. 

You may assume that the value of Ï€ = **3.141593**.

> Format your output with `setprecision(2)` to ensure the proper number of decimals for testing!
