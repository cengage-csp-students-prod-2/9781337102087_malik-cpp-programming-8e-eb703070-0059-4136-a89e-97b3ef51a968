## Instructions
Two cars *A* and *B* leave an intersection at the same time. Car *A* travels west at an average speed of *x* miles per hour and car *B* travels south at an average speed of *y* miles per hour.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter:
1. The average speed of both the cars.
2. The elapsed time (in hours and minutes, separated by a space).
 * Ex: For two hours and 30 minutes, **2 30** would be entered.

The program then outputs:
1. The (shortest) distance between the cars.

> Because your answer should be in decimal format with a precision to at least 2 decimal places, be careful when performing mathematical operations on different data types, it might give you unexpected results.
