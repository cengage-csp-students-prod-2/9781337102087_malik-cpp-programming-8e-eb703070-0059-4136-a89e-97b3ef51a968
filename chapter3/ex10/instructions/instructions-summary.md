## Instructions
Paula and Danny want to plant evergreen trees along the back side of their yard. They do not want to have an excessive number of trees. 

Write a program that prompts the user to input the following: 
1. The length of the yard. 
2. The radius of a fully grown tree. *(Use **3.14159** as the constant value for any calculations that may need `$\pi$`)*.
3. The required space between fully grown trees. 

The program outputs:
1. The number of trees that can be planted  along the back side of their yard.
2. The total space that will be occupied by the fully grown trees.

>Format your output with `setprecision(2)` to ensure the proper number of decimals for testing!
