## Instructions ##
Write a program that prompts the user to input a `string` and then outputs the `string` in the pig Latin form. The rules for converting a `string` into pig Latin form are described in *Programming Example: Pig Latin Strings of Chapter 7*. Your program must store the characters of a `string` into a linked list and use the function `rotate`, as described in *Programming Exercise 16*, to rotate the `string`.
