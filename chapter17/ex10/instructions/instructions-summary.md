*Programming Exercise 9* asks you to redefine the `class` to implement the nodes of a linked list so that the instance variables are `private`. Therefore, the `class` `linkedListType` and its derived classes- `unorderedLinkedList` and `orderedLinkedList` can no longer directly access the instance variables of the `class` `nodeType`. Rewrite the definitions of these classes so that they use the member functions of the `class` `nodeType` to access the info and link fields of a node. Also, write programs to test various operations of the classes `unorderedLinkedList` and `orderedLinkedList`.
