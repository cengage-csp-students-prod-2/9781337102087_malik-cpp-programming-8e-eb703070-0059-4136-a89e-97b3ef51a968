## Instructions ##
The function `insert` of the `class` `orderedLinkedList` does not check if the item to be inserted is already in the list; that is, it does not check for duplicates. Rewrite the definition of the function `insert` so that before inserting the item, it checks whether the item to be inserted is already in the list. If the item to be inserted is already in the list, the function outputs an appropriate error message. Also, write a program to test your function.
