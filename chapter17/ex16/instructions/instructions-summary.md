## Instructions ##
Extend the `class` `linkedListType` by adding the following function:

```
void rotate();

//Function to remove the first node of a linked list and

//put it at the end of the linked list.

```
Also write a program to test your function. Use the `class` `unorderedLinkedList` to create a linked list.
