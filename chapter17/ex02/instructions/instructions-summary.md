## Instructions ##
Extend the `class` `linkedListType` by adding the following operations:

1. Find and delete the node with the smallest info in the list. (Delete only the first occurrence and traverse the list only once.)
2. Find and delete all occurrences of a given info from the list. (Traverse the list only once.)

Add these as abstract functions in the `class` `linkedListType` and provide the definitions of these functions in the `class` `unorderedLinkedList`. Also, write a program to test these functions.
